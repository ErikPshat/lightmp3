WHAT IS IT?
-----------
LightMP3 is a MP3/OGG Vorbis/FLAC/Atrac3+/WMA player designed to drain little energy from your battery.
Can decode MP3 and ATRAC3+ via Media Engine with CPU set at 20Mhz, OGG Vorbis with CPU set at 50Mhz, MP3 via libMAD
with CPU set at 70Mhz, FLAC with CPU set at 100Mhz.
With battery at 100% and display set to minimum brightness it should last 9 hours.
With battery at 100% and display turned off (press START while playing a track) it should last more than 11
hours.


INSTALL
-------
Simply copy the LightMP3 directory under ms0:/PSP/GAME3xx, ms0:/PSP/GAME4XX or ms0:/PSP/GAME5XX depending on your custom firmware.
The src directory contains source code: you don't need it to run the application.


A NOTE ON CPU CLOCK
-------------------
Please note that default cpu clocks are higher than it needs.
This is because if you have some plugins running you can encounter problems due to cpu clock too low.
If you don't have any cpu-hungry plugin running try to set the clock with this values:
-MP3 with libMad        = 65
-MP3 with Media Engine  = 19
-OGG Vorbis             = 45
-Atrac3+                = 19
-WMA                    = 19

VOLUME BOOST
------------
Please note that by using volume boost (DPAD UP while listening to a track) to raise too much the volume you can damage the psp speakers.
Use it at your own risk.


LIBMAD EQUALIZERS
-----------------
Equalizer works only with MP3s played through libMAD!
If you want to add your own preset or change the standard ones you have to edit the file equalizers
This file contains one row for each preset.
Every row contains 34 columns separated by ;
The first column is the equalizer's long name
The second column is the equalizer's short name
Then 32 columns with the equalizer's values (in dB).

Example:
User EQ n.1;U1;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;


AUDIOSCROBBLER LOG
------------------
LightMP3 can save a .scrobbler.log file that you can then upload to your last.fm account (visit http://www.last.fm).
This feature is disabled by default.
To enable scrobbler go to the options screen.

You can upload the log through this page (remember to delete the .scrobbler.log file after uploading it):
http://paulstead.com/scrob/
Time in the .scrobbler.log is UTC, so submit your log choosing UTC.


COVERART
--------
LightMP3 will look for cover:
1.In ID3v2 info (only for MP3 files)
2.For a file named like the file + .jpg
  Ex: fileName.mp3 --> fileName.mp3.jpg
3.For a file named as the album title (from ID3 info) with jpg extension
  Ex: Album Title.jpg
4.For a file folder.jpg in the same directory
5.For a file named cover.jpg in the same directory


MEDIA LIBRARY
-------------
You can choose the media library root directory (the directory that will be scanned when you choose "Scan MS for media").
Open the settings file and change this setting:

ML_ROOT=ms0:/
Ex:
ML_ROOT=ms0:/MUSIC/


BOOKMARKS
---------
You can create a bookmark by pressing L + CIRCLE while listening to a track.
The app will quit, the next time you'll start it the player will ask you if you want to load the saved bookmark.
Once loaded, the bookmark is deleted from the ms.

NOTE: If you want the app to shut down after creating a bookmark edit the settings file and change:
SHUTDOWN_AFTER_BOOKMARK=0
to
SHUTDOWN_AFTER_BOOKMARK=1


STARTING TAB
------------
You can choose the starting tab by changing the setting START_TAB
There's no setting in the setting tab for this, so you'll have to manually modify the settings file.

START_TAB possible values:
    0 = File browser
    1 = Playlist
    2 = Playlist editor
    3 = Media Library
    4 = Settings


DEPENDENCIES
------------
To compile LightMP3 you need:
-OldSchool Library MOD (OSLib MOD)
-libMad
-libTremor
-libFLAC (built without OGG support)
-SQLite3

I built libMad, libTremor and libFLAC with
CFLAGS += -O3 -frename-registers -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer

I often update my sdk so you'll need an updated sdk to compile LightMP3.
